# Technical Skills

I credit the technical skills I have developed during my time at DU to the coursework in Daniels and the projects that we undertook. In this section I have included significant projects from some of my more robust and challenging classes such as Automating Business Processes, Optimization Modeling, Sports Statistics, and the sequence of Database classes. 

The variety and demands of these projects required the development of a vast skillset that covers many analytical techniques. A significant part of the BIA major, and potentially my favorite part, is the variety of coding skills that students are introduced to and become familiar with. This portion of the major has given me the opportunity to become familiar with coding languages such as:
- R
- Python
- VBA
- SQL
