# Technical Skills

I credit the technical skills I have developed during my time at DU to the coursework in Daniels and the projects that we undertook. In this section I have included significant projects from some of my more robust and challenging classes such as Automating Business Processes, Optimization Modeling, Sports Statistics, and the sequence of Database classes. 

The variety and demands of these projects required the development of a vast skillset that covers many analytical techniques. A significant part of the BIA major, and potentially my favorite part, is the variety of coding skills that students are introduced to and become familiar with. This portion of the major has given me the opportunity to become familiar with coding languages such as:
- Coding Languages: R, Python, VBA, SQL
- Visualization Software: Tableau, Power BI, Visio
- Microsoft Certifications: Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Access
- Additional Statistical Software: JMP, SPSS

## Examples from Class Projects
The first example I have included is the project from the Databases sequence that required us to build a database for a fictitious company from the ground up. My focus was on a company that was looking to develop a new ski pass to compete with companies such as Epic and Ikon. The development of this database relied on proficient use of SQL Server, Visio, Visual Studio, Access, and coding skills with languages such as SQL and VBA. The sheer size and depth of this project was an effective introduction into the scale and demands of the business world and I am confident that the skills I developed through this project will prove helpful in my future career. 

Two of the projects that I completed helped me to develop my Python coding skills but in vastly different ways. The Automating Business Processes class required the use of Python to create a user friendly menu that provides options to utilize different statistical techniques. The project was based on data related to US National Parks and the benefits they provide to state economies and the file provided allows users to choose from different statistical tests to evaluate the relationships between these variables. On the other hand, my Optimization modeling class used Python for the sake of optimization and the final project required us to use DraftKings data about professional hockey players to maximize points under certain constraints. These two projects combined and the techniques utilized within them, give me confidence in my ability to use Python for different purposes and I hope to continue my development in this area throughout my career.

The final project I have included comes from my Sports Statistics class in which we utilized data from professional basketball games to create a pregame report for a Denver Nuggets playoff game. This project required the use of R to create a dashboard showing game data for both teams and drawing conclusions based on this data. This class was an introduction to R for me but I enjoyed the opportunity to familiarize myself with another coding langugage and explore the posibilities of visualization with the software. I see a few similarities between R and Python and I am sure future projects will help me to understand each a little better and determine the areas in which each software excels.
