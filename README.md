# Technical Skills

I credit the technical skills I have developed during my time at DU to the coursework in Daniels and the projects that we undertook. In this section I have included significant projects from some of my more robust and challenging classes such as Automating Business Processes, Optimization Modeling, Sports Statistics, and the sequence of Database classes. 

The variety and demands of these projects required the development of a vast skillset that covers many analytical techniques. A significant part of the BIA major, and potentially my favorite part, is the variety of coding skills that students are introduced to and become familiar with. This portion of the major has given me the opportunity to become familiar with coding languages such as:
- Coding Languages: R, Python, VBA, SQL
- Visualization Software: Tableau, Power BI, Visio
- Microsoft Certifications: Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Access
- Additional Statistical Software: JMP, SPSS

## Examples from Class Projects
The first example I have included is the project from the Databases sequence that required us to build a database for a fictitious company from the ground up. My focus was on a company that was looking to develop a new ski pass to compete with companies such as Epic and Ikon. The development of this database relied on proficient use of SQL Server, Visio, Visual Studio, Access, and coding skills with languages such as SQL and VBA. The sheer size and depth of this project was an effective introduction into the scale and demands of the business world and I am confident that the skills I developed through this project will prove helpful in my future career.
